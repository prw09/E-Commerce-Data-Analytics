## Online Business Database

This project is an online business database designed to showcase my skills in database design, management, and querying. It includes a comprehensive schema with tables for customers, products, categories, orders, and order items, along with sample data and a set of queries for data retrieval and analysis.

### Introduction

The Online Business Database project demonstrates my ability to create and manage a structured database for a hypothetical online business. The database includes detailed information about customers, products, categories, orders, and order items, making it a robust solution for managing an online store.
