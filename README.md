# SQL Case Study: E-Commerce Data Optimization and Analytics

## Online Business Database

This project is an online business database designed to showcase my skills in database design, management, and querying. It includes a comprehensive schema with tables for customers, products, categories, orders, and order items, along with sample data and a set of queries for data retrieval and analysis.

### Introduction

The Online Business Database project demonstrates my ability to create and manage a structured database for a hypothetical online business. The database includes detailed information about customers, products, categories, orders, and order items, making it a robust solution for managing an online store. By using this project, one can see my proficiency in database schema design, data organization, and SQL querying.

The project includes:
- **Database Schema**: A well-defined structure with relationships between customers, products, categories, orders, and order items.
- **Sample Data**: Example records that populate the database, demonstrating realistic business scenarios.
- **SQL Queries**: Predefined queries that retrieve and analyze data, showcasing my ability to handle common business data requirements.
